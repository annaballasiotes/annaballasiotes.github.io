## Summary

I am currently a graduate student at Oregon State University pursuing a masters degree in Geography and Geospatial Science. My focus within this program includes remote sensing, vulnerable populations, and participatory GIS. My environmental science degree, water resources and climate concentration, and geography minor at UNC-Chapel Hill led me to a variety of research and internship opportunities where I enhanced my GIS skills and understanding of hydrology. I recently worked as an Environmental Scientist in the Water Business Line at AECOM, primarily developing spatial materials and reports to address regulatory compliance in the federal and municipal sectors for stormwater, wastewater, and drinking water.
